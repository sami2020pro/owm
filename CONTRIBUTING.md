## Feature requests
Please open an issue with "enhancement" label.

NOTE: I'll not respond to feature requests that are non-related, spam, or outta goal of the program.

## Bug reports
Please open an issue with "bug" label.

## Pull requests
Before working on an issue, fork the project and create a feature branch. Once you're done working, rebase your changes against the main branch and submit a pull request.

All pull requests must be fully tested before they're submitted for review.

We use the **conventional commit** pattern for our commit messages. Commit messages should include a "type" and a short description (e.g. `fix: add helper methods to show correct trace in sentry (#75)`). For new features, it sometimes makes sense to add a longer description as well. Acceptable commit message types include:

* feature (a new feature)
* fix (a bug fix)
* performance (a performance improvement)
* refactor (a change that improves upon existing code)
* readability (a change that improves the readabilities of code)
* docs (a change to the docs only)
* test (a change that only includes tests)

Lastly, make sure your commit is signed before submitting the pull request.

## Fixing whitespace, formatting code, or making purely cosmetic patches
changes that are cosmetic in nature and don't add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of this project will generally not be accepted.
